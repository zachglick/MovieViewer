# Project 1 - *MovieViewer*

**MovieViewer** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [X] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [X] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [X] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [X] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [X] User can search for a movie.
- [X] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. The app could be extended by allowing the user to view individual movies in detail
2. From a UI/UX standpoint, I'm curious how the class feels about the work we did with the "UIRefreshControl" and the "Networking Error" message.
  Is it better practice to repeatedly try the network when disconnected? Immediately show an error? Is there a middleground?
